# This module has been deprecated in favor of [generator-enyo](https://www.npmjs.org/package/generator-enyo).

This module was an experiment around using Grunt programmatically wrapped in a CLI.
It basically did what Yeoman has mastered and [generator-enyo](https://www.npmjs.org/package/generator-enyo) should be the standard way to scaffold an enyo project.
